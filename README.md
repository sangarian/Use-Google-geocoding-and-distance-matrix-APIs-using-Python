# Use-Google-geocoding-and-distance-matrix-APIs-using-Python
As a development practitioner working on education-related interventions in Lower and Middle Income Country (LMIC) contexts, you may often be interested to know  the average distance traveled by a student to a school. Generally,  public schools in Pakistan keep the record of students home addresses in their admission registers. Using this secondary data we can measure the distance travelled by each student from his/her home to his/her respective school. To do this we use Google geocoding API to turn student's physical addresses to geo location coordinates. We then use these coordinates to measure distance by leveraging google's distance matrix api and export the data as a csv file. We can further use readily  available shape files of the administrative boundaries in QGIS to find which districts students belong to.
